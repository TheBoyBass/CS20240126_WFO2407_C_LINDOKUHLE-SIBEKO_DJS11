### üîçProject-Brief
The Braincast App was inspired by the Netflix Layout.
The goal of this project was to develop a podcast application using React. The app should fetch data from a provided API and display information about various podcasts, including shows, seasons, and episodes.The  users should be able to browse, listen to episodes, and manage their favorite episodes.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:

git clone[https://github.com/TheBoyBass/CS20240126_WFO2407_C_LINDOKUHLE-SIBEKO_DJS11.git]

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheBoyBass/CS20240126_WFO2407_C_LINDOKUHLE-SIBEKO_DJS11.git
   ```
2. Change Directory
   ```bash
   cd CS20240126_WFO2407_C_LINDOKUHLE-SIBEKO_DJS11
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run Development localy:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Follow Local Link (ctrl + click)
   ```
   Local: http://localhost:####/
   ```
   
### ü§ñ Tech-Stack

**I was required to complete this project using React and a build-process to manage all the complexity involved. I decided against using type script as i am not as comfortable with it yet.** 
- `React`: Core framework for building the app
- `HTML/CSS`: For structuring and styling the app.
- `JavaScript`: For adding interactivity and handling logic.
- `React Router`: For managing navigation within the app.
  
### üì¶Usage Examples
